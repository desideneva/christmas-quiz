## INITIAL DESIGN
 For my project, I created a fun and easy-to-use website all about Christmas. It's designed for people of all ages who want to test their knowledge of holiday traditions and have a good time.

 The main features that I wanted to include are:

###  Easy Navigation:

   * A user-friendly navigation system to ensure  easy access to the quiz questions, an exit option, and a clear path to restart or play again.

###  Clear and Entertaining Content:

  * Brief and entertaining information is presented in a visually appealing manner. The quiz questions are accompanied by vibrant images related to Christmas, enhancing the overall user experience.

###  Festive Color Scheme:

  * I have included shades of red, green, and white, cheerful and festive colors to evoke the holiday spirit, creating a visually pleasant atmosphere for users.

### Engaging Visuals:

* Each question is accompanied by relevant themes as background, adding an extra layer of enjoyment for the participants.

### Interactive Elements:

* I have implemented interactive elements, such as buttons for selecting answers, and a score counter to keep users engaged throughout the quiz.

### Responsive Design:

* The quiz is made accessable on desktops, tablets and mobile phones to suit larger audience.

### Playful Tone:

* The quiz is designed to be fun, with friendly and playful style. It's like having a holiday game with friends. The goal is to make the quiz not only informative but also enjoyable for participants.

In summary, the Christmas Quiz project aims to provide a delightful and educational experience for individuals of all ages, celebrating the spirit of the holiday season through an interactive and visually appealing platform.
